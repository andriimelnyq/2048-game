# 2048 GAME
[DEMO](https://andriimelnyq.github.io/2048-game/)

2048 is an easy and fun puzzle game. Even if you don't love numbers you will love this game. It is played on a 4x4 grid using the arrows. Every time you press a key - all tiles slide. Tiles with the same value that bump into one-another are merged.

This task was implemented like the game in [this reference](https://play2048.co/).

In this game, the player must combine tiles containing the same numbers until they reach the number 2048. The tiles can contain only integer values starting from 2
(10% chance of spawning 4), and that is a power of two, like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. The board has dimensions of 4 x 4 tiles so that it can fit up to 16 tiles. If
the board is full, and there is no possible move to make like merging tiles together - the game is over.
